              The preferred value of the <code>latencyHint</code> is a value
              from <a>AudioContextLatencyCategory</a>. However, a double can
              also be specified for the number of seconds of latency for finer
              control to balance latency and power consumption. It is at the
              browser&apos;s discretion to interpret the number appropriately. The
              actual latency used is given by AudioContext&apos;s <a href="#widl-BaseAudioContext-baseLatency">baseLatency</a> attribute.
