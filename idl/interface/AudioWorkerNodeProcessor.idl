              postMessage may be called to send a message to the
              AudioWorkerNode, via the algorithm defined by <a href="https://w3c.github.io/workers/#dom-worker-postmessage">the
              Worker specification</a>. Note that this is different from
              calling postMessage() on the AudioWorker itself, as that would
              dispatch to the AudioWorkerGlobalScope.

              attribute EventHandler onmessage
            </dt>
            <dd>
              The onmessage handler is called whenever the AudioWorkerNode
              posts a node message back to the audio thread.
