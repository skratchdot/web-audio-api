            The node to which this processing event is being dispatched. Any

              A readonly Array of Arrays of Float32Arrays. The top-level Array
              is organized by input; each input may contain multiple channels;
              each channel contains a Float32Array of sample data. The initial
              size of the channel array will be determined by the number of
              channels specified for that input in the createAudioWorkerNode()
              method. However, an onprocess handler may alter this number of
              channels in the input dynamically, either by adding a
              Float32Array of blocksize length (128) or by reducing the Array
              (by reducing the Array.length or by using Array.pop() or
              Array.slice(). The event object, the Array and the Float32Arrays
              will be reused by the processing system, in order to minimize
              memory churn.

            <p>
              Any reordering performed on the Array for an input will not
              reorganize the connections to the channels for subsequent events.

              A readonly Array of Arrays of Float32Arrays. The top-level Array

              The initial size of the channel array will be determined by the
              number of channels specified for that output in the
              createAudioWorkerNode() method. However, an onprocess handler may
              alter this number of channels in the output dynamically, either
              by adding a Float32Array of blocksize length (128) or by reducing

            This object attribute exposes a correspondingly-named read-only
            <a>Float32Array</a> for each parameter that has been added via
            <a>addParameter</a>. As this is dynamic, this cannot be captured in
            IDL. The length of this Float32Array will correspond to the length
            of the inputBuffer. The contents of this Float32Array will be the
            values to be used for the AudioParam at the corresponding points in
            time. It is expected that this Float32Array will be reused by the
            audio engine.
